# Swervolf-soc

Implementation of Swervolf (A RISC-V System on a Chip) for several platforms:

- *Nexys FPGA*. For testing firmware.
- *Custom FDSOI 28nm SOC*. For hardware implementation. Includes some peripherals, built-in memory and caches (conversion to the AXI bus) and no DDR interface. Optimized for power consumption. Designed for Cadence synthesis / implementation scripts (not in this repo).
